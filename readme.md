Ultrasonic Striker for educational robot that has to strike a small ball to make it move.  Usually a ping-pong ball or a foosball.

The parts for this attachment are fairly cheap on ebay.

There is some fabrication needed to make the striker.

# Things to learn.

* Measuring distance with ultrasonic range finder
* Making stepper motors go left or right
* Making servo motors go left or right
* Convert electricity from 5v to 12v.
* python coding

# Assumptions

The main diagram assumes a 5v battery.  If 12 volt, less parts are used.
