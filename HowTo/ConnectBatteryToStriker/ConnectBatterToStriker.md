# Connect Battery To Striker

If you have a 12 volt battery, just connect it to the striker. 

If you have a 5 volt USB power supply, then follow these steps to convert 5 volts to 12 volts.


##  Create a cable

In some cases you can simple cut the cable in half and use the existing wires.  Red us usually power and Black is usually ground.  Use an Multimeter to double check.

In this case the wires were so thin, that it made more sense to just use the plug and add two new wires.

Just cut away the plastic.

See Standard A, in the image below.  

If the plug is facing you, pin 4 is negative and pin 1 is positive.

Ignore the two pins in the middle you will not need them.
